          <img src="images/thumbnail-1.jpg" alt="BookingBeatsPrototype">
           <br><p>During my spring semester I was able to work on an app of my choice, for this project I created an app for local artists to use so that they could easily book venues and get connected with different bars in their areas. It also allowed for them to connect and interact with the community around them so that they could find their target audience and build up their fan base on a closer level.</p>
